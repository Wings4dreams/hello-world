Hello to those who stumble across this,

I'm 36 years old, a gamer, and a dabbler in new and interesting experiences.
Currently enrolled in the University of South Florida for Computer Science. 
Its a risk to try such a demanding curriculum at this age, especially when 
my highest math in high school was algebra, but I hope that what I lack in 
capacity I make up for in tenacity. If not, then off to the next venture. 
I love learning new things.
